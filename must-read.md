## DB as queue instead of rabitmq :
- [read1](https://dagster.io/blog/skip-kafka-use-postgres-message-queue)
- [read2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture)

It's pretty trivial to implement a good enough queue manually in a traditional database.
For smaller apps that aren't pushing mega-amounts of messages, this my preference if it means reducing my external dependency count.
I have done this, but by the time you have multiple servers interacting with the queue for failover/scalability and have dealt with edge cases relating to that I wouldn't call it trivial. I think in the future I would certainly take a hard look at something like rabbitmq rather than roll my own.

### deployment :
    if youâ€™re self hosting a web app on Windows and IIS then you need to tweak the IIS application pool to be always on. And you can can use a background task for the processing. Or you can deploy the worker as Windows Service.
